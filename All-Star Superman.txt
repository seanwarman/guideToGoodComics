<p>I'm actually surprised at myself for how small a number of Superman comics I actually like because, honestly, I love this character through and through. But Superman suffers from a shortcoming that many superheroes suffer from when their readers reach past the age of ten: he's too good to be true.<br><br></p>

<p>Such a flawless character is prone to boring story-lines and Superman has always been the Jesus of Superheroes. To taint his character would be sacrilege. And even though it might make for a better story-line to have a more dynamic character, I personally wouldn't want to break the spell. I don't need to read a Superman comic to know that he saves the day while being a really nice guy.</p><br><br>

<p>So why should you read this Superman comic? Well maybe you shouldn't...hmm. Hold on. Er, no wait, do read it. But only if you're already a fan of Superman. Otherwise there's probably no point. I say this because it's not going to give you anything new or show you something about Superman that you haven't already seen. If you are a fan however...it's brilliant!</p><br><br>

<p>All Star Superman is like a homage to the character. It's tenderly written - which is very appropriate given that Superman is a comforting and homely character - by <bold>Grant Morrison</bold> and it's beautifully drawn in a perfect accompanying style by <bold>Frank Quietly</bold>.</p><br><br>

<p>There's nothing dark or challenging about All-Star Superman, which is probably how it should be, but there's something very special about it's tone. It has a feel to it that is very unusual for superhero comics, a sort of unashamed sentimentality that is executed in a way that draws the reader in rather than being a turn off. Instead of portraying Superman from a distance as a god-like figure All-Star Superman makes him seem more personable but without ever taking away any of his power.</p><br><br>
