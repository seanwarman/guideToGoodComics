		<h3>Most of the heroes you'll see in major blockbuster films have been around for donkeys years now...</h3><p> The initial explosion of the men-in-tights format came when Superman hit the scene in the 1930s, which is getting close to 90 years ago!</p>

		<p><b>Spiderman</b> is probably one of the most recognisable Super-Heroes of all time and he came about when <b>Marvel</b> was just starting in the 1960s along with many other very famous titles such as <b>The Hulk</b>, <b>X-men</b>, <b>The Fantastic Four</b>, <b>Thor</b> and <b>Iron Man</b>. But the Amazing Spider-Man comic definitely has something special about it.</p>
		<img class="picSettingsLeft picSizeMd" src="https://i.imgur.com/XWSpHGT.jpg">
		<p>I've gone back to read the origins of most of the famous super-heroes but I always find them a little disappointing. You realise when you read them that many of the long-running hero comics develop massively over that long period and become better as they go along, either that or they're rebooted by a talented writer who does an especially good reimagining of the story. I'm thinking of titles like <b>Daredevil</b> and also <b>Batman</b>, who both had particularly great runs when <b>Frank Millar</b> took over the writing duties, or the excellent <b>X-Men</b> run written by <b>Joss Whedon</b> (of <b>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</b>) to name a only a few.</p>

		<p>That's why when I read <b>The Amazing Spiderman</b> for the first time I was bowled over. Not only is it, in my opinion, a brilliant original super-hero comic but it has never been topped since. There's something magical in the pages of the original Spiderman comic that amounts to more than many other titles of it's time. <b>Stan Lee's</b> writing is snappy and light, he had an excellent knack for pushing the plot forwards and also seemingly an ability to churn out character ideas, as many of the most famous super-heroes are credited as his creations during this time, but he was really a nuts and bolts writer and it was clear that he was writing to a very young audience.</p>

		<p>Many believe that the key to Spiderman's poignancy was <b>Steve Ditko's</b> artwork. Most of the famous Marvel/Stan Lee creations, which I mentioned earlier, were actually designed and drawn by <b>Jack Kirby</b> (at least in part) an artist heralded by many modern comic-book artist's who had a very strong action style (which he proclaimed to have been inspired by his time in the second world war).</p>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/htQDygV.jpg" class="picSizeMd picSettingsRight">
		<p>Steve Ditko's style was different. Very much more subdued, even solemn, he gave Spiderman's everyday identity <b>Peter Parker</b> an almost hunched and down-trodden demeanour which offset Stan Lee's tendency to make light of every situation. Even though it's sometimes hard to tell given it's age, there's a soulfulness to many of the Spiderman frames which was unusual for a kids comic.  I think it's this combination which gives Peter Parker his turmoil and lends the original Spiderman a beating heart which prevails through it's more dated tropes.</p>

		<p>The Amazing Spiderman is an absolute treat to read even 50 years after it's initial publishing and there's something particularly satisfying about being able to go back to the very original version of a character this iconic and see for yourself what all the fuss was about.</p>
