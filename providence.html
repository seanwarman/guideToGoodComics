		<h4>Providence is <strong>Alan Moore's</strong> most recent comic series and some would argue that it's possibly his best...</h4>
		

		<p>...which is saying something for Alan Moore. Fabled as one of the most skilled and influential comic book writers of all time, Moore has been writing since the 70s and his portfolio consists of some absolute classic pieces of fiction.
		</p>

		<p>I've been as sparing as I can with his comics on this site, mainly because I didn't want to get too carried away. It's rare for most writers to have more than two <em>great</em> comics in their lifetimes, Moore has around a dozen. I don't want to prattle on too much like a total fanboy so I'll try and keep the gushing to a minimum.
		</p>

		<p>Having written a lot of his most popular fiction in the 80s, when the mainstream comics medium was going through a darker and more politicised phase, many would say that Moore is at his best when tackling the murky side of the human psyche. His characters are often deeply flawed and fascinatingly human, which I think is the driving force of many of his best stories.
		</p>

		<p>But actually, having said that, <strong>Providence</strong> is a bit different. The protagonist of this darkest of horror comics plays an extremely passive role in the events which he is exposed to. He is neither unlikeable or particularly likeable and he has his own strong motivations but they tend to be happenstance or circumstantial. But I would still argue that Providence is, in fact, an exploration into character, just not the lead character. Many of the events that play out in Providence are lifted from or deeply inspired by the works of <strong>HP Lovecraft</strong>, an american horror fiction writer from the 1800s.
		</p>

		<p>It's Lovecraft's character that Moore is exploring in Providence, a writer who, having spent most of his career writing horror novellas, was repressed and deeply troubled. An interesting shared fictional history has arisen from Lovecraft's work which derives mainly from his tendency to write about an ancient and secret occult book called the <strong>Necronomicon</strong>, a sort of evil Bible, an idea that was shared and incorporated into stories by other writers since and gave weight to the idea that it actually exists.
		</p>

		<p>Providence takes many of Lovecraft's stories and incorporates them into it's history while exploring the elements of his writing which Moore says were alluded to or left unspoken. Mainly being: all the sex.
		</p>

		<p>It's this side of Lovecraft's character that's being exposed to the light of day, and Providence is unflinching. It's a deeply subtextual, disturbing and intelligent horror comic that readers are already saying is amongst Moore's best work. Not for the faint of heart but a maliciously enjoyable read all the same.
		</p>

		<p>Providence is actually a sequel to two previous shorter graphic novels called <strong>The Courtyard</strong> and <strong>Neonomicon</strong> which are both well worth checking out as well.
