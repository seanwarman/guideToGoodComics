		<h3 class="paraIntro">For those just getting into comics the subject may seem a bit 		overwhelming...</h3><p>...and it is. Comics is a huge medium which has been around for longer than you 		might think and although it <i>can</i> come across as trashy or even trivial there's 	no denying it's popularity.</p>

		<img class="picSettingsLeft picSizeSm" src="images/All_Star_Superman_Cover.jpg">

		<p>
		I've included mainstream comics in this list like Grant Morrison's hugely popular 		<strong>All-Star Superman</strong> and Goscinny and Oderzo's hilarious 			<strong>Asterix</strong> stories but there's also 	titles you might not have heard of 	outside of the comic world like Joe Matt's self deprecating biopic 				<strong>The Poor Bastard</strong> or Alan Moore's long-lost superhero masterpiece 		<strong>Miracleman</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
		More and more people I know are getting interested in comics even though I live in 	a 	country where comics are considered to be quite childish. I happen to come from the 	UK 	where common pastimes tend to be taken very seriously indeed including cycling, 		shed building, gardening and, of course, paralytic drinking.</p>

		<p>
		So where do you start if you are also thinking of getting too serious about comic 		books? Well the perfect place to start with comics is by reading one that's really 		ruddy good and although there's lots and lots of different styles and comic-book 		genres it can be really easy to just stick to what you know and never venture outside 	a certain type.
		</p>

		<p>I have split my chosen favourites into categories but they are fairly broad and are 	by no means limited to any particular genre, even though that being said most western 	comic books do tend towards more fantastical themes. If you are already a fan of sci-	fi and adventure you will most probably find it easy to pick something you're going to 	like but I'll bet if you're not you could be in for a more fulfilling experience once 	you find something that you can get into.</p>
