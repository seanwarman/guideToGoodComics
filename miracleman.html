		<h1>Miracleman</h1>
		<div class="miraclemanHead headPic"></div>

		<h3>Miracleman's birth was kind of a rough one so buckle in for a history lesson...</h3>
		<p>
		Miracleman is the hero who was oddly destined to be forgotten. He was originally conceived by Mick Anglo as a character called <b>Marvelman</b> in 1954. The idea was to make a British version of the hugely successful US comics hero <b>Captain Marvel</b> who featured in the stories of <b>Shazam</b>. He would have exactly the same powers as Captain Marvel, a super-powered family and similar back-story except that Miracleman was set in England, also both characters had quite different appearances.</p>
		<p>

		<span class="noteTxt">note. notice from the 'M' in both titles that the font's are almost identical</span><br>
		To make things even less clear the publishing company were sued and had to change the name to <b>Miracleman</b>. None-the-less once released the title did pretty well in the UK until it eventually ceased publication in 1963 after UK law ceased it's ban on importing from the US and the original Shazam title soon overtook it in popularity.
		</p>
		<p>
		Funnily enough, later in it's own history Shazam was also sued for apparently being too similar to Superman, which it was actually overtaking in popularity! 
		</p>
		<p>
		So as you're probably starting to notice Miracleman was already fairly obscure to begin with. Flash forward to 1982 and Miracleman got picked up again and given to the very capable clutches of <b>Alan Moore</b>, a writer who's name is now met with applause and awe but back then was probably given the title because no one cared about Miracleman and Moore was new on the scene.

		If Alan Moore was expected to prove himself during this time he certainly achieved that. Miracleman for me is one of those dream comics that not only has a smart and challenging story-line but also all the wham-bam-thank-you-mam for that secret super-hero fanboy inside. Miracleman used a lot those familiar super-hero tropes like the the secret identity and the super-hero-family and the happy-go-lucky hero and turned them all on their heads. Moore took what was ultimately a simplistic fantasy hero comic from the 50s and, almost literally, tore it a new one! - I'm referring here mainly to a particularly contriversial issue during the comic's run that featured an intimately detailed birth scene!
		</p>
		<p>
		There are also some really effective story-telling techniques used to surprise the reader which I've rarely seen used in comics, scenes which jump from warm and funny one moment to harrowing the next or clever little details which are used to drive the story-line. Alan Moore's writing is fearless and has no problem in pushing you out of your comfort zone. He does this in Miracleman by taking away parts of the original Miracleman stories that you would have thought would be essential only to find that it takes the character to much more interesting places.

		<p>
		There have been so many copyright infringement cases against this title that it has only been reprinted once since it's initial release in the 80s and that was only a couple of years ago (some issues of the original prints Miracleman can now go for around Â£1000 on eBay!). Miracleman was also eventually effected by it's similarities to Superman making it almost impossible for any publishing company to go near it. Marvel recently won the rights to the title and released it themselves, only after having to scratch Alan Moore's name off at his own outraged request!
		</p>
		<p>
		To be honest Alan Moore is the main reason anyone would even pick this comic up so it still seems there's no hope for Miracleman to surface and receive the credit it very much deserves but if you find yourself reading this review I very much recommend finding a version of it to read, you can find scans of it online if you look hard enough and a new Marvel published version comes in three or four collections and can be found on amazon.
