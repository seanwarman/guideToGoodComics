<h3 class="paraIntro">Miracleman<h3>

<h4>Miracleman's birth was kind of a rough one so buckle in for a history lesson...</h4>
<p>
Miracleman is the hero who was oddly destined to be forgotten. He was originally conceived by Mick Anglo as a character called Marvelman in 1954. The idea was to make a British version of the hugely successful US comics hero Captain Marvel. He would have exactly the same powers as Captain Marvel and similar back-story except that he was english and wore a different costume.

<p>
To make things even less clear the publishing company were sued and had to change the name to Miracleman. None-the-less once released the title did pretty well in the UK until it eventually ceased publication in 1963 after UK law ceased it's ban on importing from the US.

So after that pretty dry and long-winded introduction you're probably wondering why you've not already heard of Miracleman/Marvelman. Flash forward to 1982 and Miracleman got picked up again and given to the very capable clutches of <b>Alan Moore</b>, a writer who's name is now met with applause and awe but back then was probably given the title because he was new on the scene.

<p>
If Alan Moore was expected to prove himself during this time he certainly achieved that. Miracleman for me is one of those dream comics that not only has a smart and challenging story-line but also all the wham-bam-thank-you-mam for that secret super-hero fanboy inside. He took was what ultimately a simplistic fantasy hero comic from the 50s and, almost literally, tore it a new one! Taking those familiar super-hero tropes like the the secret identity and the super-hero-family and the happy-go-lucky hero and turning them all on their heads.
</p>
<p>
There are also some really effective story-telling techniques used to surprise the reader which I've rarely seen used in comics, scenes which jump from warm and funny one moment to harrowing the next or clever little details which are used to drive the story-line. Alan Moore's writing is fearless and has no problem in pushing you out of your comfort zone. He does this in Miracleman by taking away parts of the original Miracleman stories that you would have thought would be essential only to find that it takes the character to much more interesting places. I've rarely had this much enjoyment from reading a super-hero comic and I'm also so glad that I found it buried under all that trivial copyright law.
</p>
<p>
There have been so many copyright infringement cases against this title that it has only been reprinted once since it's initial release in the 80s and that was only a couple of years ago (some issues of the original prints Miracleman can now go for around Â£1000 on eBay!). Marvel recently won the rights to the title and released it themselves, only after having to scratch Alan Moore's name off at his own outraged request!
</p>
<p>
To be honest Alan Moore is the only reason anyone would even pick this comic up so it still seems there's no hope for Miracleman to surface and receive the credit it very much deserves but if you find yourself reading this review I very much recommend finding a version of it to read, you can find scans of it online if you look hard enough and new Marvel published version comes in three or four collections and can be found on amazon.
