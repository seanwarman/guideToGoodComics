<h3>Joe Matt's probably the most abhorrent character's I've ever fallen in love with...</h3>

<p>
Imagine that friend you have that always seems to be messing his life up. His problems are so obvious and you're always spelling it out to him but he never seems to get it or even listen. There's something about him though that keeps you coming back for more. There's a perverse part of you that loves to hear about his awkward outbursts and his drawn out dramas. He's that guy that reminds you your life could be so much worse... you could be like him.

I'm not sure if Joe Matt knows that about you but I'd be surprised if it hasn't at least occurred to him.

I'm consistently intrigued by Joe Matt's sort of meta-narrative in The Poor Bastard, you somehow feel like you're inside his brain digging around and you imagine him glumly walking about some street having another mishap as you're reading it. But you get this feeling whenever you read any autobiographical comic. The difference with The Poor Bastard is the unpretentiousness and outright skilfulness of Joe Matt's writing and artwork. You never get the impression that he's attempting to impress you with his intelligence, he simply and clearly is an intelligent person, and he never wastes panels on over-blown artsy wistfulness or whimsy, hogging whole pages with trite introductions or "thinking space", his artwork is simple and precise but also subtly layered with extra meaning and little jokes.

It's these things that constantly redeem Joe Matt's character, the fact that he never boasts his skill (or even mentions it for that matter). In fact Matt seems intent on self destruction and nothing else, there's this dreadful aspect to The Poor Bastard where you get the impression that Matt's intentionally fucking his life up because he thinks that it makes his comics better.

The lows he finally hits are told in his later graphic novel Spent, which to be totally honest is a bit much for me to deal with, they make his escapades in The Poor Bastard seem like the glory days to put it lightly. If you have a taste for the bleak then you'll lap it up, I personally can only go so far with this kind of stuff and much prefer the semi-fictional account/summary of his child-hood which preceded it called Fair Weather, it's slightly more light-hearted.

The Poor Bastard, for me though, is the sweet-spot. It's funny, tragic and at times even poignant. You'll start the book hating Joe Matt, then you'll warm to him, then he'll impress you, then finally well frankly he'll disappoint you but whatever you finally think of him, he'll definitely manage to hold your attention.
